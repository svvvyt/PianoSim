# PianoSim

An interactive piano simulator (React). This app allows users to play piano notes visually, switch between octaves, and hear the corresponding sounds in real time. The app uses .mp3 files for authentic piano sound playback and offers an intuitive interface to simulate the experience of playing a piano.

## Features

- **Octave Switching**: Switch between different octaves with arrow buttons to explore the full range of piano notes.
- **Interactive Keys**: Click on the keys to play the notes or use the on-screen keyboard to trigger sounds.
- **Keyboard Support**: Press **Q | W | E | R | T | Y | U | I | O | P | [ | ]** on your keyboard to play notes (several notes at the same time work too). Switch between octaves by pressing **Z** or **X**. **ENG lang is required!**
- **Active Note Highlighting**: The pressed notes are visually highlighted for feedback.
